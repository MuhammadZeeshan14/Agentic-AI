# Hello Package

This project was created using the `uv` package manager in Windows Terminal.

## Project Creation

This Python package was initialized using the following command in Windows Terminal:

```bash
uv init --package hello
```

The `uv init` command created the basic project structure including:
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration and metadata
- `src/hello/` - Source code directory structure
- `src/hello/__init__.py` - Main package file
- `README.md` - This documentation file
- `uv.lock` - Dependency lock file

## What is uv?

`uv` is a fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for pip and virtualenv, offering significantly faster performance.

## Project Structure

```

├── pyproject.toml         # Project configuration
├── README.md             # This file
├── uv.lock               # Dependency lock file
└── src/
    └── hello/
        └── __init__.py   # Main package code
```

## Getting Started

To work with this project:

1. Install uv if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Install the project in development mode:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run the hello command:
   ```bash
   uv run hello
   ```

## Development

This project uses modern Python packaging standards with `pyproject.toml` for configuration and `uv` for dependency management.
